# Daily Water Year 2015

This directory should hold rasters for each day of the water year.

# Rasters

You should supply ```ET.tif``` showing the daily _ET_ for the Delta Service area for the entire year.  This should have 365 bands, and the first band should correspond to the first day of the water year 2014-10-01.

Supplying any of the additional parameters, _Kc_, _H_, _G_, would be very helpful.  Again supply these as 365 band files.

# CSV files

Any CSV files should be stored in the above directory.
