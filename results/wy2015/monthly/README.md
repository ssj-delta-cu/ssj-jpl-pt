# Monthly Water Year 2015

This directory should hold rasters for the monthly datasets

# Rasters

You must supply ```ET.tif``` showing the average daily _ET_ for the Delta Service area for the entire year.  This should have 12 bands, and the first band should correspond to the first month of the water year, 2014-10.

Supplying any of the additional parameters, _Kc_, _H_, _G_, would be very helpful.  Again supply these as 12 band files.

# CSV files

Any CSV files should be stored in the above directory.
