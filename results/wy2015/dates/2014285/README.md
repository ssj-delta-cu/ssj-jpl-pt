# Instantaneous Hi-Resolution data products

Here is where you locate your instantaneous data products. For example, if you are using landsat imagery to determine instantaneous _ET_ for a particular overpass, this is where you store those data.  We expect most of the data here to be GeoTIFF files, and had the naming parameters as described in the [results README](../../../README.md).
