# Instantaneous Data products

Supplying instantaneous data products, like landsat estimated _ET_ values is very helpful for comparison.  These should be stored in this directory. There are no required data products for this, but we encourage users to include as many intermediate products as can help comparisons.

Following the lead of some of the landsat products, we suggest that you organize your data by concatenating the year and the julian day.  For example, ```2014285`` is the first landsat overpass in the 2015 water year.
