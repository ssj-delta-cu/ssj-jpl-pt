Global translation of potential ET into actual ET

Lead: Jet Propulsion Lab, Josh Fisher, Yufang Jin

A globally-applicable ET algorithm that translates the potential ET
into actual ET.  Biophsyical remote sensing parameters are used to
quantify multiple stresses on plant function based on the
eco-physiological theory.

## [Results](./results)

This method will provide estimates of ETo,ET.....
